# True_Pianoptim

The aim of this project is to define, through numerical simulation and optimal control, new performance strategies that might help reduce exposition to risk of injuries.

The file Piano_final_version.py is a simulation of 5 chords played fortissimo with optimized movements and external forces (keys interaction)

The file Pianoptim_V1 is a simplified version of the same 5 chords but neglicting keys interaction, so without external forces.
